// we are going to re-write most of our old code
    // we are going to use util funcs, have wrapper functions that all call to a main funciton
        // after this we will refactor and clean up
            // and after that we will try to re-write using oop

// minimal variables
    // use of larger functions that call smaller ones, and depends on smaller util functions
        // scaling based on window size
            // think of an option for mobile
                // start thinking of designs
